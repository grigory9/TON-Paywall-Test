# Subscription Payment Transaction Fix

## Critical Bug Fixed

**Issue**: Subscription payment transactions were being **rejected by the smart contract** and bounced back to users.

**Transaction Hash**: `a40aa3a39a5e00efab3cfd55ef6b19a1df382915925cc43a0f263e1447103a38`

**Symptom**:
- User sent 1 TON via TON Connect
- Transaction was aborted by contract (`aborted = true`)
- Funds bounced back: user received +0.99 TON (1 TON minus gas)
- Subscription remained in "pending" status

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Contract Requirement

The `ChannelSubscription` smart contract (in `contracts/contracts/factory.tact`) has a specific receiver function:

```tact
// Line 273
receive("Subscribe") {
    let ctx: Context = context();
    let subscriber: Address = ctx.sender;

    // Calculate minimum acceptable payment (1% tolerance)
    let minPayment: Int = (self.monthlyPrice * 99) / 100;
    require(ctx.value >= minPayment, "Insufficient payment");

    // ... rest of subscription logic
}
```

**The contract ONLY accepts transactions with the text comment "Subscribe"**.

### What the Payment Bot Was Sending (WRONG)

Previous code in `payment-bot/src/bot.ts` (lines 795-801):

```typescript
// WRONG - No payload
const transaction = {
  messages: [{
    address: channel.subscription_contract_address,
    amount: amountNano,
    // NO PAYLOAD - Contract rejects this!
  }],
  validUntil: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 300
};
```

This sent a **plain TON transfer** without any message body. The contract has no receiver for plain transfers, so it **bounced the transaction back**.

---

## The Fix

### Updated Code

File: `/home/gmet/workspace/ton-paywall/payment-bot/src/bot.ts`

**Added import:**
```typescript
import { beginCell } from '@ton/core';
```

**Fixed transaction construction (lines 794-809):**
```typescript
// CRITICAL: The subscription contract requires "Subscribe" text comment
// Without this payload, the contract will BOUNCE the transaction back
// See contracts/contracts/factory.tact line 273: receive("Subscribe")
const subscribePayload = beginCell()
  .storeUint(0, 32) // Text comment opcode (0 = text comment)
  .storeStringTail("Subscribe") // The exact text the contract expects
  .endCell();

const transaction = {
  messages: [{
    address: channel.subscription_contract_address,
    amount: amountNano,
    payload: subscribePayload.toBoc().toString('base64'), // Base64-encoded BOC
  }],
  validUntil: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 300 // 5 minutes
};
```

### How It Works

1. **Create cell with text comment**: `beginCell()` creates a new TON cell builder
2. **Store opcode**: `storeUint(0, 32)` stores opcode `0` which means "text comment"
3. **Store message**: `storeStringTail("Subscribe")` stores the exact text the contract expects
4. **Encode as BOC**: `endCell().toBoc().toString('base64')` serializes the cell as base64-encoded Bag of Cells
5. **Include in transaction**: The `payload` field now contains the properly formatted message

When the contract receives this transaction, it matches the `receive("Subscribe")` handler and processes the payment.

---

## Technical Details

### TON Message Format

In TON blockchain, messages can have a body (payload) that determines how the receiving contract handles them:

- **Plain transfer**: No payload or empty cell → Bounced by contracts without fallback receiver
- **Text comment**: Opcode `0` + text → Matches `receive("text")` in Tact contracts
- **Binary message**: Opcode `0x00000001`+ data → Matches `receive(msg: MessageType)` in Tact contracts

### Why Text Comments?

Text comments (opcode `0`) are the simplest way to send messages in TON:
- Human-readable in blockchain explorers
- Easy to implement in wallets (users can see "Subscribe" comment)
- Low gas cost (no complex parsing needed)
- Direct mapping to Tact's `receive("text")` syntax

### Payload Construction Breakdown

```typescript
beginCell()
  .storeUint(0, 32)           // First 32 bits = opcode (0 = text comment)
  .storeStringTail("Subscribe") // Remaining bits = UTF-8 text
  .endCell()                  // Finalize cell
  .toBoc()                    // Serialize to Bag of Cells (binary format)
  .toString('base64')         // Encode as base64 for JSON transport
```

**Binary representation**:
```
| 0x00000000 (32 bits) | "Subscribe" (UTF-8 bytes) |
|    Opcode = 0        |    Text message           |
```

## Verification Steps

### 1. Build the Fix
```bash
cd /home/gmet/workspace/ton-paywall/payment-bot
npm run build
```

**Expected output**: No errors, TypeScript compilation succeeds.

### 2. Restart Payment Bot
```bash
# If using PM2
pm2 restart payment-bot

# Or in development mode
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Subscription Flow

**Prerequisites**:
- Active channel with deployed subscription contract
- Test wallet with sufficient TON balance (at least monthly_price + 0.1 for gas)
- Payment bot connected to testnet

**Steps**:
1. Start bot: `/start`
2. Browse channels: `/channels`
3. Select channel and click "Subscribe to [Channel Name]"
4. Choose payment method: "Pay with Telegram Wallet"
5. Connect wallet if not already connected
6. Confirm transaction in wallet
7. Wait for blockchain confirmation (~30 seconds on testnet)
8. Verify subscription activated

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Transaction sent successfully
- ✅ Transaction shows "Aborted = false" in blockchain explorer
- ✅ Contract balance increases by (monthly_price - admin_payment)
- ✅ Admin receives payment (monthly_price - 0.02 TON for gas)
- ✅ Subscription status changes from "pending" to "active"
- ✅ User granted access to channel

### 4. Verify in Blockchain Explorer

**Testnet explorer**: https://testnet.tonscan.org

Search for the subscription contract address and check latest transactions:
- Transaction should show "Aborted = false"
- Message body should show "Subscribe" text comment
- Transaction should have "Success" status

---

## Contract Address Validation

Before testing, verify the contract address format:

**Bounceable addresses** (used for smart contracts):
- Testnet: `kQC...` (base64 with CRC checksum)
- Mainnet: `EQC...` (base64 with CRC checksum)

**Non-bounceable addresses** (used for wallets):
- Testnet: `0QC...`
- Mainnet: `UQC...`

**IMPORTANT**: Always use **bounceable addresses** for subscription contracts. If the transaction fails, funds will bounce back to the user instead of being lost.

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Insufficient Payment
If user sends less than 99% of monthly price:
```tact
require(ctx.value >= minPayment, "Insufficient payment");
```
Transaction will bounce with error message.

### 2. Overpayment
If user sends more than monthly price:
```tact
let overpayment: Int = ctx.value - self.monthlyPrice;
if (overpayment > ton("0.01")) {
    send(SendParameters{
        to: subscriber,
        value: overpayment - ton("0.005"),
        mode: SendIgnoreErrors,
        body: "Overpayment refund".asComment()
    });
}
```
Contract automatically refunds overpayment (minus small gas fee).

### 3. Subscription Renewal
If user already has active subscription:
```tact
if (currentExpiry != null && currentExpiry!! > now()) {
    // Extend existing subscription
    newExpiry = currentExpiry!! + (30 * 24 * 60 * 60);
}
```
Contract extends expiry date by 30 days.

### 4. Wallet Connection Timeout
If user doesn't confirm within 2 minutes:
```typescript
const timeoutPromise = new Promise<never>((_, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        reject(new Error('Transaction confirmation timeout...'));
    }, 120000); // 2 minutes
});
```
Bot shows error and allows retry.

## Performance Considerations

### Gas Costs

**User pays**:
- Network fee: ~0.005 TON
- Contract execution: ~0.01 TON
- Admin payment forward: ~0.005 TON
- **Total gas**: ~0.02 TON

**Admin receives**:
- Monthly price minus 0.02 TON for gas
- Example: 1 TON subscription → admin gets 0.98 TON

### Transaction Speed

**Testnet**:
- Transaction submission: Instant
- Blockchain confirmation: ~30 seconds
- Payment monitoring detection: Up to 30 seconds (monitoring interval)
- **Total time**: ~1 minute

**Mainnet**:
- Transaction submission: Instant
- Blockchain confirmation: ~5-10 seconds
- Payment monitoring detection: Up to 30 seconds
- **Total time**: ~40 seconds

---

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Check Transaction Status

```bash
# Get transaction by hash
curl "https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v2/getTransactions?address=<contract_address>&limit=10"

# Check contract state
curl "https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v2/getAddressInformation?address=<contract_address>"
```

### Check Payment Monitoring Logs

```bash
# PM2 logs
pm2 logs payment-bot --lines 100

# Look for:
# - "✅ Payment confirmed for subscription X"
# - "Subscription X activated"
# - "User granted access to channel Y"
```

### Database Verification

```sql
-- Check subscription status
SELECT * FROM subscriptions
WHERE channel_id = <channel_id>
AND subscriber_id = (SELECT id FROM subscribers WHERE telegram_id = <user_telegram_id>);

-- Check payment records
SELECT * FROM payments
WHERE subscription_id = <subscription_id>
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

---

## Security Considerations

### 1. Payload Validation
The contract validates the payment amount:
```tact
let minPayment: Int = (self.monthlyPrice * 99) / 100;
require(ctx.value >= minPayment, "Insufficient payment");
```

### 2. Reentrancy Protection
TON's account-based model prevents reentrancy attacks. Each message is processed sequentially.

### 3. Gas Limit Protection
Contract uses `SendIgnoreErrors` mode to prevent gas exhaustion:
```tact
mode: SendIgnoreErrors
```
If forwarding fails (e.g., admin wallet invalid), contract still processes subscription.

### 4. Subscription Expiry
Contract stores expiry on-chain:
```tact
self.subscribers.set(subscriber, newExpiry);
```
Cannot be tampered with by backend.

---

## Rollback Procedure (If Needed)

If the fix causes issues:

### 1. Revert Code
```bash
cd /home/gmet/workspace/ton-paywall/payment-bot
git checkout HEAD~1 src/bot.ts
npm run build
pm2 restart payment-bot
```

### 2. Alternative: Manual Payment Method
Direct users to send payment manually:
1. Open TON wallet
2. Send payment to contract address
3. Add comment: "Subscribe"
4. Payment will be processed automatically

---

## Future Improvements

### 1. Subscription ID in Payload
Currently using text comment "Subscribe". Could enhance to include subscription ID:
```typescript
const subscribePayload = beginCell()
  .storeUint(0x12345678, 32) // Custom opcode
  .storeUint(subscriptionId, 64)
  .endCell();
```

Requires contract update to accept binary messages.

### 2. Multi-Month Subscriptions
Allow users to pay for 3/6/12 months at once:
```tact
receive(msg: ExtendedSubscribe) {
    let months: Int = msg.duration;
    newExpiry = now() + (months * 30 * 24 * 60 * 60);
}
```

### 3. Discount Codes
Add support for promotional codes:
```tact
receive(msg: SubscribeWithCode) {
    let discount: Int = self.validateCode(msg.code);
    let discountedPrice: Int = (self.monthlyPrice * (100 - discount)) / 100;
    require(ctx.value >= discountedPrice, "Insufficient payment");
}
```

## Support

If issues persist after applying this fix:

1. Check contract deployment status in blockchain explorer
2. Verify contract has sufficient balance for gas (should auto-maintain from payments)
3. Check payment bot logs for errors
4. Verify database connection and subscription records
5. Test with small amounts on testnet first

For contract-related issues, consider redeploying the subscription contract with the factory.
